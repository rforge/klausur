ChangeLog for package klausuR

## 0.12-0
  - drastic changes: klausur() and klausur.mufo() from now on only take objects of the new class
    klausur.answ, which replaces the 'answ' and 'corr' arguments completely. Most of the time
    it took to evaluate tests was squeezing data with exotic variable names and loads of
    surprises into a valid data.frame. Those days should finally be numbered now...
  - added function klausur.data() to do the squeezing into klausur.answ class objects (s.o.)
  - the class klausuR gained a new slot 'misc' to preserve whatever unused variables are left over
    from the squeezing process.
  - added function nret.translator() to convert NRET/ET data from/to SPSS

## 0.11-3
  - aligned penalty for false negatives to number of correct alternatives in NRET/ET scoring
  - for NRET/ET, moved determination of max. points etc. to new internal function nret.minmax()

## 0.11-2
  - added internal function roxy.package() to ease development
  - added initial support for elimination testing (ET) and number right elimination testing (NRET)
  - fixed "Form" addition in klausur.gen()

## 0.11-1
  - fixed bug in points (were logical instead of numeric, which caused trouble for PDF generation)
  - fixed annoying "show" warning

## 0.10-1
  - complete rewrite of klausur.compare(): less and more efficient code
  - replaced "na.replace" option with a plain "na.rm", i.e., NA cases are dropped completely by default
  - added new "na.rm" option to plot method, TRUE by default
  - added variable "Form" to klausur.gen()
  - replaced several "if(a == b)" constructs with "identical(a, b)" or "isTRUE(...)"
  - fixed: klausur.report() accidently created PDFs in a loop over and over again
  - fixed: klausur.report() failed if "#" appeared in names
  - fixed: klausur.report() didn't show partial results correctly, added check for needed digits
  - added slots "wght" and "points" to class klausuR

## 0.10-0
  - added klausur.mufo() and new S4 class klausuR.mult: initial support for parallel test forms
  - added show() and plot() methods for objects of class klausuR.mult
  - added support for objects of class klausuR.mult in klausur.report()
  - fixed missing import of tools package
  - dropped roxygen dependency (still using roxygen, though)
  - some code cleanup for better readability

## 0.9-7
  - added direct PDF creation to klausur.report(), using texi2dvi() from package tools
  - consequently added the tools package as a dependency

## 0.9-6
  - added schemes "DIHK", "USA" and "UK" to klausuR.gen.marks()
  - added informative slot "marks.sum" to objects of class klausuR
  - updated the show method for klausuR objects accordingly
  - added "marks.info" option to klausur.report(), to include all or parts of "marks.sum" if wanted

## 0.9-5
  - fixed another bug in klausur.compare(): objects with NAs meant trouble.
  - added "select" option to klausur.compare() to be able to focus on certain variables

## 0.9-4
  - added support for different file name scheme to klausur.report() (matr. no. or name_firstname)

## 0.9-3
  - added "alt.comma" parameter to klausur.report()
  - minor corrections in the documentation (some missing params in usage)

## 0.9-2
  - restructured the LaTeX output
  - fixed some bugs in klausur.compare()
  - added parameters to skip cronbach's alpha and item analysis in klausur()
  - cronbach's alpha and item analysis now run in a safe tryCatch() environment
  - modified the show() method accordingly

## 0.9-1
  - added "alpha if removed" calculation for each item
  - added longtable support for klausur.report()
  - fixed some bugs in klausur(), klausur.report() and plot() regarding character vectors

## 0.9-0
  - added support for partially correct answers (if multiple correct answers possible)
    via the new "score" parameter
  - more cleaning up: moved some subroutines to internal functions

## 0.8-1
  - added marks A to F as an option in klausur.gen.marks()
  - adjusted the plot method to treat marks as characters
  - beautyfied the output of individual results in klausur()
  - cleaned up a bit (removed unused relicts from klausur.R)
  - translated hopefully all comments in the code into english

## 0.8-0
  - added feature to suggest marks by normal distribution

## 0.7-0
  - initial public release (via reaktanz.de)
